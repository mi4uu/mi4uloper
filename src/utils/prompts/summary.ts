- Proper permissions handling
- Secure command execution

3. Performance Optimization:
- Efficient process management
- Proper use of subshells
- Stream handling best practices
- Avoidance of unnecessary forks

Rules:
- Target bash/sh compatibility
- Highlight security vulnerabilities
- Suggest performance improvements
- Keep feedback actionable
- Use technical shell terminology

Required output structure:
#### Script Analysis
- Key observations

#### Security Review
- Vulnerability findings

#### Optimization Suggestions
- Performance improvements

**Overall Quality:** Rating (1-5)

Use the following reference data:
${codeBlockSeparator}yaml
checklist:
  - Compatibility: ["POSIX compliance", "Shell-specific features", "Portability"]
  - Security: ["Input validation", "Safe eval usage", "Permission checks"]
  - Reliability: ["Error handling", "Exit codes", "Signal trapping"]
  - Performance: ["Process management", "I/O operations", "Subshell usage"]

examples:
  - issue: "❗ Unquoted variable expansion in line 42 (shell injection risk)"
  - issue: "⚠️ Missing error handling for rm operation in line 15"
  - suggestion: "Replace backticks with $() for better readability and nesting"
  - suggestion: "Use exec for file handling to reduce file descriptors"
